                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">Who are you?</p>
                    <p class="answr">We cannot introduce ourselves to you. That would be too much of a risk. We do not want to get busted, and even a single detail could make it easier for the authorities to track us down. Altough do not expect much, we are just plain, grey people. Carding does not require us to be anything more than that.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">Do you cash out the cards yourselves?</p>
                    <p class="answr">Yes, yet not every single one, that would be definitely unreasonable and too risky. We need to spread the traces around the world to make sure the cards are not traced back to one single area where we cash them out, rather than that the traces are all over the world. It makes it easier for us to cash them out safely. We also cannot cash them all out, the amount of money gone from the ATMs would attract some unwanted attention that could lead to a serious investigation in our area of operation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">What if I want to cash out in a different currency than EUR?</p>
                    <p class="answr">The cards' balances will get exchanged automatically basing on the current exchange rates, including a small fee that we can do nothing about. It is not much, so we guarantee it will not hit you hard.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">How safe are those cards in reality?</p>
                    <p class="answr">Prepaid cards are absolutely zero-risk. It is the best to remain as unsuspicious as it is possible while using them. It is impossible to track you down solely by your look, unless you are a celebrity of course.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">How do you deliver cards?</p>
                    <p class="answr">We send all cards to another country to DSC (Drop Stealth Courier). DSC resend it to buyer inside books, magazines, etc.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">Why don't you send packages by yourselves?</p>
                    <p class="answr">Risk is to high. We need to be sure that we are safe.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">How can I order cards?</p>
                    <p class="answr">Look through our regulations at section 'PAYMENT'. If you accept our regulations, contact us.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">What forms of payment do you accept?</p>
                    <p class="answr">We only accept payments by Bitcoin. It is the best way to process these types of transactions, as it is the most anonymous and popular option out there.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">Do I need to give you my full address?</p>
                    <p class="answr">No. You do not necessarily have to order them straight to your door. It is up to you where you want the cards delivered. For example, you can have them shipped to a post office or courier service office.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">What is type H and type F?</p>
                    <p class="answr">Our inside mark. Difference is in day limit cashout. Type H - 500 EUR day cashout limit, Type F - 1000 EUR day cashout limit.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">WHY don't you sell cards with amount more than 5,000 EUR?</p>
                    <p class="answr">Our experience: After first ATM - card contact you will have 5-7 days to cashout everything, on 6-8 day card will be blocked.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq_itm">
                    <p class="qstn">How can I trust you?</p>
                    <p class="answr">Check 'ANTI-SCAM' section.</p>
                </div>
