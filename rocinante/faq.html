          <p><span>WHY our*?</span> Im not one who do this big thing, it's impossible to do by one person.</p>
          <p><span>WHY my**?</span> I sell and contact with you and I'm responsible for all transfers, pins, tracking numbers and other.</p>
          <p><span>WHY you dont sell me card?</span> Maybe something wrong with you, and you are GhostBuster. Maybe I have paranoia, who knows?!</p>
          <p><span>WHY so expensive?</span> Do I look like RobinHood?! For example: If you know some winning numbers in lottery to win 2000EUR but you, your friends and family cant play this lottery for what amount will you sell this numbers? I hope you got answer!</p>
          <p><span>WHY do you sell it but not use by yourself?</span> My partner told me that we cant any more cashout from ATM in our area (need to take a break for some time), but if we travel to other country then we need spend time, money for hotels, tickets and other.. and we will receive ~same money as we sell cards.</p>
          <p><span>WHY is so big difference in shipping cost?</span> We send all cards to another country to DSC (Drop Stealth Courier). DSC comment about delivery: maybe we will use book, maybe chocolate, maybe nuts, maybe president airplane, or some big ass to deliver it.. or package in chocolate, or chocolate in book, book in ass, ass in president airplane.. LOL</p>
          <p><span>WHY so much time to prepair stealth shipping?</span> Read message before.</p>
          <p><span>WHY you dont ship packages by yourself?</span> Risk is to high! I need to be sure that we are safe.</p>
          <p><span>WHY you dont answer to me?</span> Maybe I have a talk with JackDaniels, making new cards, sleeping or maybe you didnt read all this. If I go offline for more than 24h I will write when I be back.</p>
          <p><span>WHAT is type F and type H?</span> Our inside mark. Difference is in day limit cashout, and max. amount on cards.</p>
          <p><span>WHY you dont sell card with amount more than 5,000 EUR?</span> Our experience: After first ATM - card contact you will have 5 - 7 days to cashout everything, on 6 - 8 day card will be blocked. We can offer card with 7,500 EUR maximum amount but you can cashout only 500EUR/day (1000EUR/day), so if I sell you card with 7,500 EUR but you will withdraw 3,000 EUR, and card will be blocked, what "beautiful" words will you say to me?</p>
          <p><span>WHY all prices in EUR, can I cashout USD - EUR - YEN - POUND - ROUBLE from this card?</span> You can cashout any type of your local currency.</p>
          <p><span>HAVE some fake money, ID, driving license, passports, guns, drugs?</span> NO!</p>
